# Cursor Rules for RIA Marketing Page

## Autonomy Level: FULL

You have permission to operate autonomously. This means:

- DO NOT ask "Would you like me to..." — just do it
- DO NOT ask "Should I proceed?" — the answer is yes
- DO NOT explain what you're about to do — just do it
- DO NOT stop after each step to check in
- DO NOT generate placeholder implementations

When given a task, complete it fully. Make reasonable assumptions. Fix errors yourself (try 2-3 times before asking).

## Project Context

- **Project:** RIA Marketing Page (you-are-paying-too-much.com)
