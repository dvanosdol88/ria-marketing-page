Peter Lynch observed: 
"Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves.


Conclusion: The evidence points to a clear strategy
The research assembled here supports an investment philosophy built on three pillars: appropriate asset allocation, broad market exposure through low-cost vehicles, and the discipline to remain invested through volatility. This isn't merely conventional wisdom—it's the conclusion demanded by four decades of academic research, industry studies, and behavioral data.
The key insight from the Brinson studies, properly understood, is that market exposure dominates returns. The behavior gap research demonstrates that the primary threat to investor wealth is not market risk but investor behavior. The missing-best-days data shows why market timing fails even for professionals. The SPIVA scorecard proves that active management destroys value on average. Together, these findings describe a world where simplicity wins: diversify broadly, keep costs low, maintain discipline, and let time and compound returns do the work.
Perhaps most striking is the asymmetry between effort and outcome. Sophisticated strategies, constant monitoring, and frequent trading not only fail to add value—they reliably subtract it. As Bogle memorably put it: "In investing, you get what you don't pay for." Goodreads The investor who does less earns more, and the one who accepts market returns rather than chasing excess returns tends to outperform those who try harder. In a field filled with complexity, the optimal approach remains elegantly simple: buy the market, pay as little as possible, and stay invested.

Rick Ferri, a prominent analyst and advocate for low-cost investing, emphasizes that "AUM fees are the best kind of passive income there is… For an advisor". This quip underscores the misalignment 3of incentives. The advisor’s income is secured by the asset base, while the investor’s outcome is endangered by the compounding drag of the combined fee structure.
