# I left a good firm because I couldn't give you my best advice.

A fiduciary is legally and ethically bound to put your interests first—always. But I learned that credentials alone don't guarantee unconflicted advice. The business model matters more.

## Keep your custodian. Upgrade your advice.

It’s easy for any advisor to say “objective,” “independent,” and “unconflicted.”

Here’s proof you can verify: **we don’t require you to move your money.**

- With Fidelity? Stay with Fidelity.
- With Schwab? Stay with Schwab.
- Interactive Brokers? Great.
- Vanguard or E*TRADE? Also fine.

Most major custodians offer broad, overlapping menus of low-cost ETFs and mutual funds. We build your strategy using what’s already available where you invest—so you keep control.

**Advice on your terms**

- Standard hours: Mon–Fri, 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM  
- Select evening appointments (rotating): until 7:00 PM  
- One Saturday per month: 10:00 AM – 4:00 PM  

## The Problem I Couldn't Ignore

At my former firm, despite high ethical standards and good intentions, I was limited to offering three things:

- A diversified portfolio of mutual funds (with the standard 1% fee)
- A handful of Separately Managed Accounts
- A fixed or variable annuity

That's it. Cookie-cutter. I have a CFA® charter. I have a CFP® certification. And I was handing everyone the same playbook.

I wasn't doing anything differentiated. I started to feel like I was breaking my own fiduciary promise—not because of bad intentions, but because of a limited scope.

## The Model That Fixes It

Two structural changes **remove the biggest conflicts**—and make the advice verifiable.

### Traditional Model

- ✗ Products to sell  
- ✗ Must transfer your assets  
- ✗ Fee grows with your portfolio  
- ✗ Same playbook for everyone  

### My Model

- ✓ No products. Advice only.  
- ✓ Stay with your current custodian.  
- ✓ Flat $100/month. Your growth is yours.  
- ✓ Tailored strategy using top models.  

**This isn’t a convenience feature. It’s proof.**

If I earned money by moving your assets, I would need you to transfer. I don’t.  
Your accounts can stay where they are—so you can verify the relationship is advice-first.

## The Credentials Behind the Promise

## What This Looks Like in Practice

Unconflicted advice means I can say things most advisors can't.

**“You don't need that product.”**  
I don't earn a dime from what you buy—so I'll tell you when something isn't worth it.

**“Stay where you are.”**  
Keep your custodian, your accounts, your broker. I'll work with what you have.  
**That’s how you know the advice is unconflicted: I have no incentive to move you.**

**“Here's the honest answer.”**  
No sales pitch. No upsell. Just the answer to your question.

## How this works (without moving your accounts)

1) **Start with what you already have**  
You share your current holdings (statement/export). We review fees, risk, taxes, and what you’re actually getting for what you pay.

2) **Get a plan built for your current platform**  
We recommend specific, low-cost funds and ETFs available at your current custodian—without forcing a transfer.

3) **Implement at your pace**  
You stay in control. We guide execution step-by-step and keep the strategy aligned over time.

## FAQ

**Do I need to transfer my accounts?**  
No. Your accounts can stay with your current broker/custodian. That’s the point—independence you can verify.

**What custodians do you work with?**  
Most major brokerages offer broad menus of low-cost ETFs and mutual funds. If you’re at a large, reputable platform, you’re typically already in a great place.

**Do you sell products or earn commissions?**  
No. We don’t earn commissions and we don’t get paid by what you buy. We charge a flat monthly fee, so incentives don’t change based on your portfolio size or product selection.

**Why does staying with my custodian matter?**  
Because it removes the most common conflict: an advisor who needs your assets on their platform to get paid. Keeping your assets where they are makes it easier to verify the relationship is advice-first.
