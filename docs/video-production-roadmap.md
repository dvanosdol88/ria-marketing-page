# Video Production Roadmap — Smarter Way Wealth
## "Out-Produce Morgan Stanley with a Smartphone and $50/month"

**Created:** 2025-02-25
**Status:** Active
**Goal:** Launch a 4-video series for QR-code direct mail + website embedding

---

## Phase 0: One-Time Setup (Week 1) — ~$50-100 + 2 hours

### Hardware
- [ ] **Ring light** — Amazon, ~$25-40 (18" is ideal for face shots)
- [ ] **Lavalier mic** — Rode Wireless GO II or budget clip-on, ~$30-60
- [ ] **Phone mount/tripod** — Any smartphone tripod, ~$15-20
- [ ] **Filming location** — Clean, professional background. Home office is fine. Bookshelf or simple wall. NO virtual backgrounds.

### Software Subscriptions
- [x] **ElevenLabs** — Already have (voice cloning for voiceover/corrections)
- [x] **Gemini** — Already have (Veo for AI B-roll generation)
- [x] **OpenAI** — Already have (Sora for supplementary footage if needed)
- [ ] **Descript** — $24/month Creator plan (THIS IS THE HUB — editing, captions, filler removal, eye contact, Studio Sound)
- [ ] **Bitly or QR Code Dynamic** — $10-35/month for trackable dynamic QR codes

### Voice Clone Setup
- [ ] Record 3-5 minutes of clean audio reading a script in ElevenLabs for voice cloning
- [ ] Test cloned voice with a few sentences — verify it sounds natural and warm

---

## Phase 1: Script Writing (Week 1-2) — 3-4 hours

Write all four scripts BEFORE filming. This lets you batch-record in one session.

### Video 1: HERO — "What's It Like Working With a Real Advisor Who Charges $100/month?" (75 sec)
This is the QR code destination from your direct mailer.

| Segment | Duration | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Hook** | 0-5 sec | Warm greeting, first name, face fills frame. "Hi, I'm David." |
| **Pain point** | 5-20 sec | "If you're paying 1% to a big firm and you're not sure what you're getting for it..." |
| **Value prop** | 20-50 sec | CFA/CFP credentials, what clients get (named advisor, answers the phone, comprehensive planning, $100/month flat), one MS contrast: "At the big firms, you get a team in a call center. Here, you get me." |
| **CTA** | 50-75 sec | Schedule a free call, visit site, or reply to the mailer |

### Video 2: "What You're Actually Paying Your Advisor" (45 sec)
Fee comparison — make the math visceral.

| Segment | Duration | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Hook** | 0-5 sec | "Let me show you what 1% actually costs." |
| **Math** | 5-35 sec | $500K portfolio at 1% = $5,000/year. Over 10 years with growth = $60K+. Smarter Way = $1,200/year. Show the dollar difference, not the percentage. |
| **CTA** | 35-45 sec | "See what you're really paying at youarepayingtoomuch.com" |

### Video 3: "The Call Center Test" (45 sec)
Exploit MS's operational weakness.

| Segment | Duration | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Hook** | 0-5 sec | "Try this right now. Call your financial advisor." |
| **Challenge** | 5-30 sec | "Do you get them? Or do you get a menu? A hold queue? A different person every time?" |
| **Contrast** | 30-45 sec | "At Smarter Way Wealth, you get David. Every time. That's the whole point." |

### Video 4: "What a CFA/CFP Actually Does For You" (60 sec)
Educational + credibility builder.

| Segment | Duration | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Hook** | 0-5 sec | "Most people don't know what their advisor is actually certified to do." |
| **Education** | 5-45 sec | What CFA and CFP mean, the rigor behind them, what comprehensive planning includes vs. "just picking stocks" |
| **Bridge** | 45-60 sec | "This is what you deserve from an advisor — and you shouldn't have to pay a fortune for it." |

### Script Tips
- Write conversational, not corporate. Read each script out loud before finalizing.
- Target 130-150 words per minute (natural speaking pace).
- 75 seconds ≈ 165-185 words. 45 seconds ≈ 100-115 words.
- Include the Jensen Huang "Purpose vs Task" framing: Your PURPOSE is helping clients achieve their goals. Compliance and paperwork are tasks. Lead with purpose.

## Phase 2: Film Day (Week 2-3) — 2-3 hours, ONE session

### Batch-Record All Four Videos in One Shoot

**Pre-shoot checklist:**
- [ ] Ring light positioned at eye level, slightly above
- [ ] Lavalier mic clipped, tested for levels
- [ ] Phone in portrait (9:16) mode, 1080x1920
- [ ] Background clean, professional, consistent
- [ ] Dressed in the same style you'd wear meeting a client (no suit required — smart casual works)
- [ ] Scripts printed or on a tablet BELOW the camera (Descript Eye Contact will fix gaze later)
- [ ] Water nearby
- [ ] Phone on Do Not Disturb

**Filming tips:**
- Record each video 2-3 times. You'll pick the best take in editing.
- Smile before you start speaking. It changes your vocal tone.
- Pause 2 seconds before and after each take (clean edit points).
- Don't worry about "ums" or small mistakes — Descript removes them automatically.
- Keep energy slightly HIGHER than feels natural — camera flattens energy.

**Total raw footage needed:** ~30-45 minutes of recording for ~4 minutes of final content.

## Phase 3: Post-Production (Week 3-4) — 3-4 hours

### Descript Workflow (this is where AI does the heavy lifting)

1. **Import** all takes into Descript
2. **Studio Sound** — One click. Removes room echo, background noise. Makes any room sound professional.
3. **Filler word removal** — One click. Strips all "ums," "uhs," "you knows."
4. **Eye Contact correction** — One click. Makes you look directly into camera throughout.
5. **Select best takes** — Descript shows full transcript. Read it, cut the weaker versions.
6. **Trim and tighten** — Cut dead air, long pauses, weak sections. Edit the text = edit the video.
7. **Overdub fixes** — If you flubbed a word or want to change a phrase, TYPE the correction. Descript uses your voice clone to regenerate that segment with matching lip sync.
8. **Add captions** — Automatic animated captions. Style them: white text, dark background bar, large font. 75-85% of viewers watch silent first.
9. **Export** — 1080x1920 MP4, high quality

### B-Roll Enhancement (Optional but Recommended)

Use Gemini (Veo) to generate 5-8 second supplementary clips:
- Professional office establishing shots
- Abstract financial imagery (charts trending up, retirement lifestyle)
- Lifestyle footage matching your target demographic (pre-retirees, comfortable homes)

Layer these OVER your narration during the "math" or "education" segments — not during face-to-camera segments. Your face is the trust signal; B-roll is the visual variety.

### Final Output
- [ ] Video 1: Hero (75 sec, 9:16 portrait, captioned)
- [ ] Video 2: Fee comparison (45 sec, 9:16 portrait, captioned)
- [ ] Video 3: Call center test (45 sec, 9:16 portrait, captioned)
- [ ] Video 4: CFA/CFP education (60 sec, 9:16 portrait, captioned)
- [ ] Also export 16:9 landscape versions of each for website embedding

## Phase 4: Distribution & Website Integration (Week 4-5)

### QR Code + Direct Mail Setup
- [ ] Create dynamic QR code via Bitly (or similar) pointing to hero video landing page
- [ ] QR destination = dedicated landing page on youarepayingtoomuch.com (NOT YouTube, not Vimeo — your domain, your analytics)
- [ ] Track: scan count, watch duration, click-through to booking
- [ ] Dynamic QR means you can swap the destination video later without reprinting mailers

### Website Video Integration
- [ ] Create a `/video` or `/watch` landing page — minimal design, auto-plays hero video, CTA below
- [ ] Embed landscape versions on relevant existing pages:
  - Hero video on homepage
  - Fee comparison on your pricing/fee comparison page
  - CFA/CFP video on your "About" page
- [ ] Host videos via Vercel-friendly solution (Cloudflare Stream, Mux, or self-hosted MP4 with lazy loading)

### Social Distribution (Low Priority but Free)
- [ ] Upload all 4 to YouTube Shorts (portrait versions)
- [ ] Upload to LinkedIn as native video
- [ ] Consider Instagram Reels if your audience is there (likely secondary)

---

## Phase 5: Measure & Iterate (Ongoing)

### Key Metrics to Track
- QR code scan rate (scans / mailers sent)
- Video completion rate (what % watch to end)
- CTA click-through rate (video → booking page)
- Booking conversion rate (booking page → scheduled call)
- Cost per acquisition (total spend / new clients from video funnel)

### Quarterly Content Refresh
- Record 1-2 new videos per quarter addressing common client questions
- Rotate the QR destination to test different hooks
- Build a library over time — this compounds. James Conole's 110K subscribers started with video #1.
