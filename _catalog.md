  - **Brand green #00A540 NOT USED** in any Batch 4 file — various other greens used
  - **new-route-gemini.md and new-route-cgpt.md are NOT planning docs** — they're content files (HTML/markdown copy)
  - **page.tsx (home)** is extremely minimal — just CostAnalysisCalculator + footer
  - **faq/page.tsx** is a placeholder (same pattern as production routes)
  - **how-it-works/substitution** uses Recharts (like upgrade5) but with different visualization approach

## Shared Components + Utility Files

---
### AnimatedHeader.tsx — shared component
**Path:** `src/components/improve/AnimatedHeader.tsx`
**Size:** 15.8KB
**Summary:** The signature animated header component showing "Improved Tools → Better Information → Smarter Decisions → Better Outcomes" with responsive mobile/desktop layouts.

**Color note:** **USES BRAND #00A540** — correctly uses the brand green throughout (in color transitions, modifier text, final state).

**Props/Config:**
- No props — self-contained component
- Uses internal items array for word pairs
- 10-stage animation sequence with timings array

**What it renders:**
- [_] Mobile layout (< 768px): Vertical stack with stubby down arrows between word pairs
- [_] Desktop layout (≥ 768px): Horizontal flow with hand-drawn right arrows
- [_] Stage 1-6: Sequential reveal of "Improved/Tools", "Better/Information", "Smarter/Decisions" with arrows
- [_] Stage 7: "Better/Outcomes" drops from above
- [_] Stage 7.5: Scale-up effect on final word pair
- [_] Stage 8: Color transition — modifiers go dark, "Tools" and "Better Outcomes" go brand green
- [_] Stage 9: "Improved" slides up, "Tools" slides down (position swap)
- [_] Replay button: Small gray circle (not the big green button) — appears at stage 8

**Used by (from previous batches):**
- improve-your-tools/page.tsx (Batch 3 — **production route**)
- improve-your-tools-v0/page.tsx (Batch 3)

**Unique content worth noting:**
- **This is the canonical component** used by production
- Small gray replay button (different from .jsx files which have larger buttons)
- TypeScript with proper typing
- Uses Tailwind classes (bg-neutral-50) vs inline styles in .jsx versions

**Relationship to other files:**
- **vs Improve-tools-header-final-responsive.jsx (Batch 3):**
  - Nearly identical animation logic
  - .jsx has larger green "Replay" button; .tsx has small gray circle with ↻
  - .jsx uses inline bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-50; .tsx uses Tailwind bg-neutral-50
  - .jsx has drop-shadow on text; .tsx has drop-shadow via filter
  - .jsx has green underlines under base words; .tsx does NOT have underlines
- **vs Improve-tools-header-v0.jsx (Batch 3):**
  - v0 is simpler, desktop-only
  - v0 has outline-style replay button visible only at stage 7

---
### ImprovePage.tsx — shared component
**Path:** `src/components/improve/ImprovePage.tsx`

**Color note:** Uses green-500/600 (Tailwind defaults) — **NOT brand #00A540**.

**Props/Config:**
- `version: number` — determines which variant to render (1, 2, or 3)
- Uses `@/config/improveToolsPageConfig`:
  - `improveToolsVariants[version]` — hero content, features, comparisonCards
  - `improveToolsNavItems(version)` — navigation items

**What it renders:**
- [_] Header: "Improve Your Tools" with green dot, nav items from config, "Get started →" CTA
- [_] Hero: headline + subhead from config, "Questions? Let's Talk →" button, "See the tools ↓" link
- [_] Hero Image: Zoomable RightCapital cashflow-waterfall.gif (react-medium-image-zoom)
- [_] Features: Mapped FeatureSection components from config
- [_] Comparison: "Not All Advice Is Created Equal" with ComparisonCard grid
- [_] CTA: "Questions about how this works?" with consultation button

- improve1/page.tsx (Batch 3) — version={1}
- improve2/page.tsx (Batch 3) — version={2}
- improve3/page.tsx (Batch 3) — version={3}

**Unique content worth noting:**

- Same structure for all 3 versions — only config content differs
- Does NOT use AnimatedHeader — uses static hero headline instead

**Relationship to other files:**
- **vs improve/page.tsx (Batch 3):** Similar structure but uses different config (improvePageConfig vs improveToolsPageConfig)
- **vs improve-your-tools-v0/page.tsx (Batch 3):** Similar but v0 uses AnimatedHeader and FeatureSectionStacked

**Unique content worth noting:**
- Uses same projection engine as home calculator
- Shows "what could you buy with savings" visualization
- Two chart types: area chart (FeeComparisonChart) and bars (FeeBreakdownBars)

**Relationship to other files:**
- Uses same buildFeeProjection as how-it-works/page.tsx
- Charts are Recharts-based (like upgrade5)

### BATCH 5 SUMMARY — Shared Components + Utility Files
- **Total files scanned:** 8
- **Key findings:**
  - **AnimatedHeader.tsx vs the two .jsx versions:**
    - All three use #00A540 correctly
    - .tsx is the production version (imported by improve-your-tools)
    - .tsx has small gray replay button; .jsx files have larger buttons
    - .tsx does NOT have green underlines; final-responsive.jsx DOES
    - Recommend: Keep .tsx as canonical, but consider merging underline feature from .jsx
  - **ImprovePage.tsx:** Config-driven component for improve1/2/3, uses green-500/600 (NOT brand green)
  - **SaveProofClient.tsx:** Renders fee projection charts, uses same engine as home calculator
  - **globals.css brand color:** #00A540 NOT defined in globals.css — it's in tailwind.config.ts. Slider uses wrong green (#22c55e).

### Animated Header Comparison (all 3 implementations)
- [_] src/components/improve/AnimatedHeader.tsx — **Production version.** Uses #00A540. Small gray replay button. No underlines. TypeScript.
- [_] src/app/Improve-tools-header-final-responsive.jsx (Batch 3) — Most polished visual. Uses #00A540. Large green replay button. HAS green underlines. Drop shadows.
- [_] src/app/Improve-tools-header-v0.jsx (Batch 3) — Simpler. Desktop-only. Outline replay button at stage 7 only.
→ **Recommendation:** AnimatedHeader.tsx is canonical (used by production). Consider merging underline feature from final-responsive.jsx. Move .jsx files to archive or delete.

### ImprovePage Versions (via config)
- [_] version=1: Uses improveToolsVariants[1] — specific hero/features/comparisons from config
- [_] version=2: Uses improveToolsVariants[2] — different content from config
- [_] version=3: Uses improveToolsVariants[3] — different content from config
→ **Note:** All 3 versions render the same structure — only config content differs. Need to check `@/config/improveToolsPageConfig` to see actual differences.
→ **Recommendation:** Review config file to determine if versions are meaningfully different.
